This directory contains some scripts used to generate and use GPG keys
for Mageia.

To use them, gpg needs to be installed, and ssss-combine ssss-split
binaries should be in ./bin directory (or path updated in config file).

- generate-key : generate a new GPG key, copy the public key in ./public
  directory. The private key is encrypted and copied in file
  ./private/mageia-board-seckey.gpg. The password is split in 6 parts
  using "Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme" with this program :
   http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/
  3 parts are required to combine the password and decrypt the key.

- move-part : script used to move on a USB key one part of the password
  and a copy of the encrypted GPG key. The public directory is also copied.
  It takes as argument a number (between 1 and 6) and a path.

- import-priv-key : this script import the private key in directory
  ./homedir using encrypted key and 3 parts of the password. Copy all
  password parts in directory ./private/parts, the encrypted key in
  ./private/mageia-board-seckey.gpg, run the script and you should be
  able to use gpg with "gpg --homedir ./homedir"
